# Nestor — Starter Repository (Next.js + NestJS)

This is a **GitHub-ready starter scaffold** for the Nestor real-estate booking platform.
It contains minimal, working skeletons for:

- Frontend: Next.js (React) app (pages skeleton, Tailwind-ready)
- Backend: NestJS skeleton with sample controllers for auth, projects, properties, bookings
- Docker Compose for local development
- Sample SQL seed and `.env.example`
- Instructions to run locally and what to implement next

## What's included (minimal)
- frontend/ (Next.js)
- backend/ (NestJS)
- docker-compose.yml
- .env.example
- scripts for seeding / development notes

## How to use
1. Extract the zip or clone the repo.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.
3. Use Docker Compose to bring up services or run frontend/backend separately.

### Quick (local dev)
```bash
# from repo root
docker-compose up --build
```
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend:  http://localhost:4000

## Next steps (recommended)
- Implement DB migrations (Prisma / TypeORM / Sequelize).
- Implement auth flows (JWT + email verification).
- Implement Razorpay/Stripe integration.
- Seed sample projects and properties.
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) and code linting.
